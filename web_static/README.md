HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It consists of a series of elements or tags that define the structure and content of web pages.

To create an HTML page, you need to follow these basic steps:

Open a text editor.
Write HTML code to define the structure and content of your page.
Save the file with a ".html" extension.
Open the file in a web browser to view the rendered HTML page.
A markup language is a system for annotating text to specify its structure, presentation, or semantic meaning. HTML is an example of a markup language used primarily for creating web pages.

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

An element (or tag) in HTML represents an individual component within a web page, such as a heading, paragraph, image, or link.

An attribute is additional information provided within the opening tag of an HTML element that can modify the element's behavior or provide additional metadata.

When a browser loads a webpage, it follows a series of steps including:

Parsing the HTML document to construct the DOM.
Loading external resources such as CSS and JavaScript.
Rendering the content of the page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It enables you to control the layout, styling, and appearance of web pages.

To add styles to an HTML element, you can use CSS properties within a style block in the HTML document or link an external CSS file to the HTML document.

A class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to one or multiple HTML elements to apply specific styles or functionality to those elements.

A selector in CSS is a pattern used to select the elements you want to style. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.

CSS Specificity Value is a numerical representation of the specificity of a CSS selector. It determines which CSS rule will be applied to an element when multiple conflicting rules exist.

Box properties in CSS refer to properties that control the visual aspects of the rectangular boxes that make up elements on a web page. These properties include dimensions (width and height), padding, margin, border, and positioning.
